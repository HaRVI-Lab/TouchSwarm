# Touchswarm

## Introduction
**Touchswarm** is an innovative physical human-drone interaction system designed around the Crazyflie 2.1 and the Crazyswarm platform. It enables users to render force and create diverse haptic feedback, seamlessly integrating with 3D systems. This makes it a versatile tool for researchers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in drone interaction technologies.

## Features
- **Haptic Feedback:** Generate tactile sensations to simulate the sense of touch in human-drone interactions.
- **3D System Integration:** Easily incorporate Touchswarm with existing 3D systems for enhanced interactivity.
- **Open Source:** Both hardware and software components are open-sourced for community collaboration and improvement.

## Hardware
The hardware component includes a specially designed cage for the Crazyflie 2.1 drone. This cage is crucial for safe and effective interaction.

- **Cage STL File:** Available for direct 3D printing. The design ensures optimal balance between protection and functionality.

## Software
The software aspect comprises two main elements: the firmware for Crazyflie and the Crazyswarm system. This ensures seamless operation and easy integration with various platforms.

- **Crazyflie Firmware:** Custom firmware to enhance the drone's capabilities for physical interactions.
- **Crazyswarm Software:** A robust system for controlling and managing multiple drones in a coordinated manner.

## Getting Started
To get started with Touchswarm, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** `git clone https://github.com/HaRVI-Lab/TouchSwarm.git`
2. **Hardware Setup:** Print the cage using the provided STL file and assemble it with the Crazyflie 2.1 drone and CrazyRadio 1.
3. **Software Installation:** Follow the installation instructions in the software documentation to set up the Crazyflie firmware and Crazyswarm system. In this implementation, we used Ubuntu 20.04 and ROS Noetic.
